"""Compare two Gauntlet runs game-by-game, including round-count movement.

Usage:
    tools/compare_gauntlets.py <baseline_dir> <candidate_dir>

Both directories are `gauntlet/<run-id>/` outputs (must contain
results.csv). For each (opponent, map, bot_side) key present in both:

  - If the win/loss outcome flipped, it's reported separately (this is
    already reflected in the two runs' WinPct, nothing new here).
  - If the outcome held the same, compute a round delta:
      win:  baseline_rounds - candidate_rounds   (positive = won faster)
      loss: candidate_rounds - baseline_rounds   (positive = lasted longer)
    A positive delta is progress toward winning even when the win/loss
    column didn't move -- the game got closer to flipping, not just
    "the same". A negative delta is regression in the same sense.

This is a *tracked* metric only (see TRAINING_ALGORITHM.md's "Logging"
section) -- it is not currently used to gate accept/reject decisions.
Round count alone doesn't capture everything that matters (e.g. a
2000-round stall isn't obviously "better" than a clean 400-round loss),
so treat this as a secondary signal for judging whether a near-miss
represents real margin progress, not a replacement for WinPct.
